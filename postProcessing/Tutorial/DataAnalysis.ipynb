    "In the example below, we use the following conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - We deliberately choose to use the matplotlib.pyplot.subplots routine even when creating a single figure (as opposed to using pyplot.plot). This is because many online forums (e.g Stackoverflow) use this syntax. Furthermore, this means you do not have to learn two different types of syntax when creating either a single or multiple panel figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - We choose to do the binning within the numpy/array environment instead of with inbuilt functions such as plt.hist / axes.hist. The reason is that you have more control over what you do, such as custom normalization (using rates, weights, pdf, etc.). It also forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are calculating, and allows you to check intermediate steps with print statements.  Once you know how to bin your data this way you can also easily expand these routines for more complicated plots (2D binning)."
